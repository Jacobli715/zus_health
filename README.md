# Rook Survival Chess Simulation

This project simulates a simplified chess scenario where a rook attempts to survive 15 rounds while moving according to randomized rules, and a stationary bishop attempts to capture it using standard diagonal movement.
The simulation is visualized using Pygame

How to Play ?:

1. To play this feature just download Pygame on the IDE of this code: pip3 install pygame
2. Just click roll to start the feature and we hope the rook will survive !!!
3. The Bishop will always be stationed at h3, we are trying to move the rook by flipping a coin for directions and then 2 dice roll for steps
4. GOOD LUCK AND ENJOY !!!

Choice of Language: Why Python ?

1. Python was selected because when I first think of chess, I think of game and when coding a game simulation, the first thing that came to my mind was Pygame. Initially I was going to code
this in HTML/CSS/JS but I just wanted to build it in python since it has more relevance and easier to use


Pros:
1. The Pygame feature and UI shows how the rock moves
2. The roll button creates a interaction experience with the user
3. Easy to add more feature and pieces for future references


Cons:
1. There is limited UI designs and adding more features and sprites could drop the performance
2. It is not suited for large simulation and is slower than other langauge such as C++
